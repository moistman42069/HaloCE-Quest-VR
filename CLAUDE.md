# Agent and contributor continuation

## Active candidate: test19 (unpublished)

Candidate `test19-network-browser` is prepared for private testing: both APKs are **1.0.1 / code 20**. Read [TEST19-PROGRESS.md](docs/TEST19-PROGRESS.md) and the test19 delivery/community review for source identity, hashes, verification and unresolved device cases. Preserve public 1.0/test14; wait for candidate feedback before a new release.


Canonical repository: `moistman42069/HaloCE-Quest-VR`, default branch `main`.
Read docs/CURRENT-STATE.md, docs/RELEASE-PROVENANCE-1.0.0.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
and relevant player/architecture/protocol documents before changes.

Current public baseline: **release 1.0**, tag `v1.0.0`. The owner explicitly
re-authorized publication using the exact delivered test18 APKs. This supersedes
the test18 publication hold. Both APKs retain **1.0-test18 / code 19** internally;
only release filenames change. Do not rebuild, re-sign or replace them. Public
test14 stays unchanged. See RELEASE-PROVENANCE-1.0.0.md for hashes/build source.
Publication authorization is not a newly reported headset/campaign playthrough.
Future APK updates must use code >19 and need separate publication approval.

Preserve accepted VR animation handoff, Legs + Arms, room-scale legs, fingers,
contact/grip, online native melee, Safe VR geometry and Normal flat geometry.
Keep the flat touch/controller, co-op/NPC/avatar, logging, browser and managed
set implementations. Co-op is two-player for concrete lifecycle/recovery reasons;
128 PvP slots do not establish 128-player campaign or Quest hosting performance.
Do not invent disc-revision labels, verified content matching, directories or
headset acceptance. Record code, automated checks and device evidence separately.

Keep all new local work/builds on D: on the maintainer's Windows machine. Other
systems use a writable clone. Check status and read continuation docs first.
Build VR/flat serially; native staging is shared. Preserve each APK before a
flavor switch. No game install/launch or unrelated upstream push without a
corresponding instruction. Use GitHub noreply authors; never publish private
history, personal paths/emails, keys, game assets, raw logs/media or invitations.
Required third-party license notices remain intact.

Every future release must have self-contained notes in the nine-section order
in docs/RELEASE-TEMPLATE.md, installation and APK download links first. Upload
only the two APKs plus updater compatibility metadata unless another asset has
a concrete purpose. Preserve existing releases. Future version names, increasing Android codes, stable tags, APK names and
UpdatePolicy must agree. The exact-byte test18-to-1.0 promotion is a documented
owner-directed exception, including the same-code updater message.
Older test updaters require one manual install of 1.0; do not disguise that
limitation with fake compatibility metadata or duplicate legacy releases.
